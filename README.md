# Watercolor paintings by neural networks

I trained neural networks to generate watercolor paintings from pencil sketches. The input is a pencil sketch drawn by me, and the outputs are watercolor paintings generated by neural networks. See an example below:

# pix2pix 

This image-to-image transfer idea (also known as "pix2pix") is proposed by: 
Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A. Efros. 
[Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004). 
CVPR 2017.

It designs a conditional version of [generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (GAN) to learn a mapping from input images to output images. Some example applications from the original "pix2pix" paper:

# Tensorflow implementation

The implementation is based on the Tensorflow port by [Christopher Hesse](https://github.com/christopherhesse), with the following changes,
- GAN Discriminator: multiply discriminator loss by 0.5 to slow down its learning, as suggested in the original paper. 
- GAN Generator: added one more layer in encoder and one more layer in decoder to work with images of size 512 by 512.
- Some clean-up to make the code more “light weight” for my application.

### Prerequisites
- Tensorflow 1.9.0

### Recommended
- Linux with Tensorflow GPU edition + cuDNN
